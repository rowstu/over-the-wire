ssh bandit25@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220

Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easyâ€¦ The shell for user
bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works
and how to break out of it.

Had to lookup a walkthrough for this one. Not really real world. The shell was a
script that launched "more" to display a text file. If you make your terminal
window small enough more obviously waits for you to press a key to move through
the text file. But you can break out of more by entering v (for visual and then
enter the following commands:

:set shell=/bin/bash
:shell

Which opens bash. At which point you see we have finished this challenge:

bandit26@bandit:~$ ls
README.txt  text.txt
bandit26@bandit:~$ cat README.txt 
Congratulations on solving the last level of this game!

At this moment, there are no more levels to play in this game. However, we are
constantly working
on new levels and will most likely expand this game with more levels soon.
Keep an eye out for an announcement on our usual communication channels!
In the meantime, you could play some of our other wargames.

If you have an idea for an awesome new level, please let us know!
