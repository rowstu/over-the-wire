ssh bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220

The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

bandit13@bandit:~$ ls 
sshkey.private

ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost -p2220

bandit14@bandit:~$ ls
bandit14@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
