ssh bandit24@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220

A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 
if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. 
There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
You do not need to create new connections each time

for i in {0000..9999}; do echo <snip> $i | nc localhost 30002; done

this method is way to slow. trying a script:

for i in {0000..9999}; do echo <snip> $i >> in; done

in the end I had to split this into two 500 line files as it appeared to die after a while. Im not sure what sort of throttling is in place on the server.
But in my case I found the pin in the 500+ file:

cat in | nc localhost 30002 >> out

Correct!
The password of user bandit25 is <snip>
