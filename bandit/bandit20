ssh bandit20@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220

There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

NOTE: Changes to the infrastructure made this level more difficult. You will need to figure out a way to launch multiple commands in the same Docker instance.

NOTE 2: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think

Start a tmux session with:

$ tmux new -s wibble

Inside there, do the following:
bandit20@bandit:~$ echo -n GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j | nc -l 30100

Then disconnect from the tmux session: CTRL+b d

Then use the suconnect setuid binary in the home directory;

bandit20@bandit:~$ ./suconnect 30100
Read: GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
Password matches, sending next password

Looks good, so reattach to the tmux session and see what it has sent us:

bandit20@bandit:~$ tmux attach -t wibble
[detached (from session wibble)]
