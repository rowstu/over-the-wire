# over-the-wire challenges

Personal notes.

Since uploading these notes I've noticed the levels have been updated and consequently, there are new passwords. So I've gone through the challenges upto level 26 (so far). Ive removed all passwords from the notes and stored these in a separate file that doesn't get commited to the git repo.

For personal reference only.
